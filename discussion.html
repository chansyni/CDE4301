            <h2 id="conclusion">5.1. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The primary focus of the first phase of the project was clinical immersion and exploration to gain a comprehensive understanding of the unmet needs 
              in obesity treatment, specifically in developing an option that balances efficacy and invasiveness. Following concept generation and design, an 
              initial prototype was created to validate the functionality of the proposed mechanism.
              <br><br>
              In the next phase, further iterations of the device will be developed and tested, with the aim of applying them in real-life scenarios. The ultimate 
              goal is to create a product that is key in revolutionising minimally invasive bariatric surgery, increasing the appeal and accessibility to 
              individuals who would benefit from it, thereby driving higher adoption rates of bariatric surgery.
              <br><br>
              It is important to note, however, that obesity is a multifaceted issue that cannot be addressed by surgery alone. A holistic approach is required, 
              which includes adopting a disciplined lifestyle and maintaining healthy habits, such as proper nutrition and regular physical activity. On a broader 
              systemic level, more initiatives could be implemented to address the root causes of obesity, such as improving access to healthier options, increasing 
              public health awareness, and fostering a supportive environment for sustainable lifestyle changes.

        <div>
            <h2 id="project-challenges">5.2. Project Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              We are fortunate to have clinical mentors who offer valuable clinical immersion opportunities. However, this exposure may have inadvertently limited 
              our perspective, causing us to focus primarily on current clinical techniques, potentially hindering our creativity. To foster innovation, it is 
              essential that we broaden our approach by seeking inspiration from other fields, such as pipe systems (which share similarities with the tubular 
              structure of intestines) and expertise from experts from other industries.
              <br><br>
              Another challenge we face is the lack of engineering expertise within the team, as most members come from non-technical backgrounds. Nevertheless, 
              these members offer alternative perspectives that are crucial to the innovation process. To overcome this, we will leverage the resources and expertise 
              available at NUS, such as the MVP studio and guidance from engineering professors, to enhance the technical aspects of our project.

            <p>
              Table 10 details the project timeline for the next 6 months. The initial experimental phase, aimed at establishing prototyping parameters, will be 
              followed by the design cycle phase that includes the design, fabrication and iterative testing of prototypes. User feedback from bariatric surgeons 
              will be incorporated throughout the process. The final phase involves the development of a business and marketing strategy to bring the solution to market.
