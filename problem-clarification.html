    <div>
      <!--Section 2.1: Setbacks of Bariatric Surgery-->
      <div id="setbacks">
          <h2>2.1. Setbacks of Bariatric Surgery</h2>
          <p>
            Despite the clinical efficacy of Bariatric Surgery, its uptake amongst eligible patients remains low, with less than 1% of those 
            qualified actually opting for the procedure (Gasoyan et al., 2018).
            <br><br>
            This underutilization represents a significant unmet healthcare need, as individuals struggling with obesity and its related comorbidities 
            continue to experience compromised quality of life and incur higher healthcare expenditures for chronic obesity management. Additionally, 
            progress in addressing the growing burden of obesity and its associated diseases is hampered.
            <br><br>
            Leaky Bucket Model (Figure 6) is used to estimate the prevalence of Bariatric Surgery in Singapore.

      <!--Section 2.2: Reasons for Low Bariatric Surgery Uptake-->
      <div id="reasons-low-uptake">
        <h2>2.2 Reasons for Low Bariatric Surgery Uptake</h2>
        <p>
          Primary research was conducted to investigate the low uptake of Bariatric Surgery. Interviews were conducted with patients 
          (n=10) from the Obesity Health Centre at the Singapore General Hospital, to assess patient sentiments towards Bariatric Surgery. 
          These consisted of patients who have previously undergone bariatric surgery and patients who had not. Key responses, corresponding 
          insights and the frequency of each sentiment are summarised in Table 2. 
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/PatientResponses.png" subtitle="Table 2: Patient insights" width="70"></image-component>
        <p>
          The resounding sentiment is the concern towards the safety of the surgery, expressed by 9 out of 10 interviewees. In particular, 
          safety assurance is especially crucial in bariatric surgeries, because unlike the majority of other surgeries, it addresses a chronic 
          condition that is not immediately life-threatening. Patients were more likely to question the necessity of taking on surgical risks for 
          a condition they had already lived with for a long time.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, further investigations revealed that patients perceived less invasive procedures to be safer. This aligns with the decreased 
          pain, lower risk and shorter recovery times often associated with less invasive procedures (Kernodle Clinic, 2020). In a separate survey 
          amongst obesity patients, more than 85% of respondents indicated a preference for an endoscopic procedure (Figure 7), given a similar surgical 
          efficacy across techniques. This signals a clear preference for minimally invasive methods, and is an indicator that there is a potential for 
          the adoption rate of bariatric surgery to increase if endoscopic approaches are incorporated and advocated as viable options.
        </p>

      <!--Section 2.3: Problem Scope-->
      <div id="problem-scope">
          <h2>2.3. Problem Scope</h2>
          <p>
            Corroborating insights from patient interviews with findings from research literature, we identified the two primary factors that 
            significantly influence patients’ decisions regarding treatment options:
          </p>
          <p><b>Efficacy</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>% Weight loss</li>
            <li>Remission of comorbidities</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Perceived Safety</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Risk of surgical complications</li>
            <li>Pain experienced</li>
            <li>Reversibility of procedure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additionally, procedure invasiveness was identified as a major determinant in patients’ safety perceptions, with less invasive procedures 
            generally viewed as safer. 
            <br><br>
            Revisiting the current treatment options (Section 1.3), a clear correlation between procedural efficacy and invasiveness is observed. This 
            poses a trade-off between efficacy and perceived safety of the procedures. This highlights an opportunity to develop a less invasive bariatric 
            solution that maintains a high efficacy, improving perceived safety and hence potentially increasing treatment uptake.

      <!--Section 2.4: Stakeholder Needs-->
      <div id="stakeholder-needs">
          <h2>2.4. Stakeholder Needs</h2>
          <p>
            The two primary stakeholders in the solution’s development are bariatric surgeons, who are the customers, and obese patients, who are customers. 
            Bariatric surgeons will need to be convinced of the novel procedure's efficacy, safety, and practicality before offering it as a treatment option. 
            Obese patients will directly experience the procedure’s outcomes and therefore require assurances of its safety, effectiveness, and alignment with 
            their treatment preferences. Tables 3 and 4 outline the specific needs and priorities of each stakeholder group.

      <!--Section 2.6: Problem Statement-->
      <div id="problem-statement">
          <h2>2.6. Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            Severely obese patients (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) with co-morbidities in Singapore are hesitant to undergo bariatric surgery due to its invasiveness 
            which leads to a perceived lack of safety, including the risk of pain and surgical complications.
            <br><br>
            This is a key factor in the adoption rate of bariatric surgery, the gold standard for metabolic weight loss treatment, amongst eligible patients 
            being less than 1%, despite its efficacy in reducing patient’s weight by 20-30%.
          </p>
      </div>

      <!--Section 2.7: Value Proposition-->
      <div id="value-proposition">
          <h2>2.7. Value Proposition</h2>
          <p>
            A novel minimally invasive bariatric technique that delivers clinical outcomes comparable to that of existing laparoscopic bariatric surgeries 
            (20-30% weight-loss, 5-10% complication risk), reducing the trade-off between efficacy and perceived safety. This is achieved by replicating the 
            laparoscopic gold standards endoscopically, positioning it as a safer and viable alternative for patients and healthcare providers.
