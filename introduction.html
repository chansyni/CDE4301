        <h2>1.1. Background of Obesity</h2>
        <!--Section 1.1.1: Definition-->
        <div id="definition">
            <h3>1.1.1. Definition</h3>
            <p>
                Obesity is clinically defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI) exceeding 30kg/m², with severe obesity defined as BMI over 35kg/m² 
                (Singapore Ministry of Health, 2022). The BMI is a metric for assessing body mass weight relative to height, calculated by 
                dividing an individual’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in metres) (Cleveland Clinic, n.d.). 
            </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section 1.1.2: Prevalence-->
        <div id="prevalence">
            <h3>1.1.2. Prevalence</h3>
            <p>
                Globally, over 1 billion individuals are affected by obesity, with its worldwide prevalence more than doubling since 1990 (World 
                Health Organisation, 2024). This trend is similarly reflected in Singapore, with the rate of obesity increasing from 5.1% in 1991 
                to 11.6% in 2022 (World Obesity Federation, n.d.). Projections indicate a continued upward trajectory, affirming obesity as a 
                severe global health epidemic (Koliaki et al., 2023).

        <!--Section 1.1.3: Causes-->
        <div id="causes">
            <h3>1.1.3. Causes</h3>
            <p>
                Obesity is a complex condition influenced by multiple factors.
                <br><br>
                A primary cause is an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. Genetic predispositions that affect metabolism 
                and fat storage can also make individuals more prone to weight gain. Additionally, environmental and social factors such as 
                limited access to healthy foods, sedentary lifestyles, and socioeconomic barriers can contribute to obesity (NHLBI, NIH, 2022).
            </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section 1.1.4: Health Risks-->
        <div id="health-risks">
            <h3>1.1.4. Health Risks</h3>
            <p>
                Obesity is associated with a myriad of health risks, significantly increasing the likelihood of the development of comorbid 
                conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Sleep Apnea, Cardiovascular Diseases and specific 
                cancer types (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2023). On average, individuals with obesity 
                incur an additional $720 annually in medical expenses as compared to those with a healthy BMI (Chay et al., 2022).

        <h2>1.2. Treatments for Obesity</h2>
        <p>
            Table 1 summarises the various treatment options for obesity.
        </p>
        <!--Section 1.2.1: Lifestyle and Dieting-->
        <div id="lifestyle-and-dieting">
            <h3>1.2.1. Lifestyle and Dieting</h3>
            <p>
                Lifestyle and Dietary Modification is the foundational approach to obesity management. It is primarily aimed at achieving a caloric 
                deficit, whereby energy expenditure outweighs caloric intake. This can be facilitated by caloric restriction via dietary adjustments, 
                or increasing energy expenditure via increased physical activity (Wadden et al., 2020).
                <br><br>
                Although this is the most natural way of weight reduction, this method relies heavily on patient adherence to strict dietary and exercise 
                regimens. This compliance can be particularly challenging for a variety of reasons, for example, changes to appetite-related hormones 
                that induce increased hunger and cravings (Wadden et al., 2020). 
                <br><br>
                Lifestyle and dietary modifications yield variable outcomes and are therefore generally insufficient as a standalone, long-term solution 
                for effective weight loss and maintenance. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <!--Section 1.2.2: Medication-->
        <div id="medication">
            <h3>1.2.2. Medication</h3>
            <p>
                Weight-loss pharmacotherapy targets the regulation of hormones released post food intake, to modulate metabolic processes. 
                For example, semaglutide mimics Glucagon-like Peptide-1, a hormone that promotes satiety and slows gastric emptying. The medication 
                is self-administered via subcutaneous injection, typically using an injection pen delivered into the abdomen. Dosing intervals range 
                from daily to weekly, depending on medication type and doctor’s recommendation (Kommu & Whitfield, 2024).
                <br><br>
                Consistent medication usage confers about 5-10% weight loss on average (Tchang et al., 2024). However, weight regain is common and 
                expected upon medication discontinuation, necessitating chronic use to achieve long-term weight loss outcomes (Tchang et al., 2024). 
                At a monthly cost of $200-300, sustained use may impose financial burdens on the patient.

        <!--Section 1.2.3: Endoscopic Bariatric Procedures-->
        <div id="endoscopic-bariatric-procedures">
            <h3>1.2.3. Endoscopic Bariatric Procedures</h3>
            <p>
                Endoscopic Bariatric Procedures (EBP) are performed using a flexible endoscope, which is inserted trans-orally to access the 
                Gastrointestinal (GI) tract, facilitating a 15-20% weight loss on average (Lee et al., 2023). 
                <br><br>
                The Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (Figure 1) is a widely utilised technique, in which the stomach is sutured internally to reduce gastric size. 
                Another common procedure involves the placement of an inflatable Gastric Balloon (Figure 2) into the stomach, causing a reduction in its available 
                volume (University of Michigan Health, n.d.).
            </p>
            <image-component tag="image" source="assets/ESG.png" subtitle="Figure 1: Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty"></image-component>
            <p>
                EBPs are constrained by the functionality and manoeuvrability of the endoscope, limiting the ability to achieve comprehensive metabolic 
                changes. Hence, the primary focus of EBPs is the naive approach of gastric restriction, which is unsustainable in the long term due to 
                the adaptation of the human body with time, leading to an expected weight regain (Mauro et al., 2023). Additionally, adverse side effects 
                such as discomfort and acid reflux are frequently reported (Mohamed et al., 2022).
            </p>

        <!--Section 1.2.4: Bariatric Surgery-->
        <div id="bariatric-surgery">
            <h3>1.2.4. Bariatric Surgery</h3>
            <p>
                Bariatric surgery aims to surgically alter parts of the GI system, such as the stomach or small intestine. Currently, most 
                bariatric surgeries are performed laparoscopically. Bariatric surgery has shown to confer 20-30% weight loss and remission of 
                comorbidities such as T2D (Lee et al., 2023), making it the gold standard for obesity management.
                <br><br>
                Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) (Figure 3) is the most common procedure, accounting for 70% of bariatric surgeries in Singapore. It reduces 
                gastric volume via the removal of approximately 70% of the stomach, to limit food intake. The Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) (Figure 4) 
                and One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) (Figure 5) involve bypassing approximately 150-200cm of the small intestine to reduce digestion 
                and nutrient absorption (Lee et al., 2023). This is achieved by constructing a new anastomosis between the distal part of the small intestine 
                and the stomach. The RYGB and OAGB differ in their anatomical configurations, with the RYGB resulting in two anastomoses, while the OAGB 
                involves a simpler, more straightforward single anastomosis.
